# moment-playground

Many times I've found myself in need of a quick way to try out various formatting options provided by [moment.js](https://momentjs.com/). This is a simple environment intended to fill that need.

## Usage

The `start` script runs `moment.js` with nodemon. Any changes will trigger a re-run.

```
npm run start
```
